# Before you start

Before you start testing GOV.UK Pay, you should:

* read the ["Get started"
guide](https://www.payments.service.gov.uk/getstarted/) to decide if
GOV.UK Pay is right for your service 
* sign up for [the GOV.UK Pay admin
tool](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/create-service/register) 
* read the government guidance on [deploying new
software](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/making-software/deployment.html).

If you want to build a technical integration between your service and the GOV.UK
Pay API, your service team should have the necessary skills. You can refer to the
[Service
Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/the-team/what-each-role-does-in-service-team#roles-your-team-must-have)
for more information. This does not apply if you only use [payment
links](/payment_links/#payment-links).

If you are new to the GOV.UK Pay API, you can read the "[Quick start guide]"
section of this documentation.

You may also want to use payment links rather than integrate with the GOV.UK Pay
API if your service:  

* is non-digital and uses paper applications to process payments
* is non-digital and has low transaction volumes
* asks users for payment by sending email or letters
* does not have a development team that can integrate your service with GOV.UK Pay

You can read more in the ["Payment links"](/payment_links/#payment-links)
section.
