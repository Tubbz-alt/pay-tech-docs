# Account structure 

If you have multiple services integrated, you can treat them separately or as
a combined single service within GOV.UK and your Payment Service Provider
(PSP). This gives 3 possible account configurations.

## Configuration examples

You might have 2 services called "parking permits" and "parking fines":

### Type 1 (GOV.UK Pay separate, PSP separate)

"Parking permits" and "Parking fines" are considered as separate services in
both GOV.UK Pay and the PSP. In this setup, payments to services can go to
separate bank accounts because each service has a PSP account. 

### Type 2 (GOV.UK Pay combined, PSP combined)

"Parking permits" and "Parking fines" are considered as a single combined
service in GOV.UK Pay and in the PSP. In this setup, payments to services must
go to the same bank account because they are a single service in the PSP. 

### Type 3 (GOV.UK Pay separate, PSP combined)

"Parking permits" and "Parking fines" are considered as separate services in
GOV.UK Pay and as a single combined service in the PSP. In this setup,
payments to services must go to the same bank account because they are a
single service in the PSP. 

## Editing GOV.UK Pay services 

Each service defined in GOV.UK Pay has its own API.

In GOV.UK Pay, within each service you can edit: 

* user permissions 
* email templates to users
* accepted card types
* the name that appears on the payment pages 
* whether you accept 3DS 

## Editing PSP services 

Within each gateway account for the PSP, you can edit: 

* what appears on bank statement of your users 
* which of your bank accounts your revenue goes to
