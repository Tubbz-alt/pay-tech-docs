    You must store your API keys securely. You must not share this key in publicly accessible documents or repositories. You must not share it with anyone who should not be using the GOV.UK Pay API directly.

Read this section to learn about what to do to get started with GOV.UK Pay.

## Before you start

Before you start using GOV.UK Pay, you should:

* read the [__Get started__
guide](https://www.payments.service.gov.uk/getstarted/) to decide if GOV.UK
Pay is right for your service

* sign up to the [GOV.UK Pay admin
site](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/create-service/register)

* read the GOV.UK Service Manual guidance on [deploying new
software](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/making-software/deployment.html)

* sign up to the [API
explorer](https://gds-payments.gelato.io/) if you want to use it to test the API

If you want to build a technical integration between your service and the
GOV.UK Pay API, your service team should have the necessary skills. You can
refer to the [GOV.UK Service
Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/the-team/what-each-role-does-in-service-team#roles-your-team-must-have)
for more information. This does not apply if you only use [payment
links](/payment_links/#payment-links).

## The GOV.UK Pay API

The GOV.UK Pay API is based on REST principles with endpoints returning data
in JSON format, and standard HTTP error response codes. The platform API
allows you to:

* begin and complete payments
* view the event history for individual payments
* view transactions within a specified time period
* issue full or partial refunds

When you've received a test account, follow these instructions to get started
with our API Explorer and make a test API call.

## Generate API Key for API Explorer

1. Sign in to the [GOV.UK Pay admin
   site](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/) with the test
   account login details you received.

2. From the landing page, select __API key__, then __Generate a new key__.

![](images/pay_9.png)
 <br /><br />Enter a description for your API key: <br /><br />

![](images/DescribeAPIKey+image2.png)
<br /><br />Your API key will be shown for you to copy:<br /><br /> ![](images/NewKeygenerate+image+3.png)

[Read the __Security__ section](/security/#security) for more information on how
to keep your API key safe.

## API Explorer setup

The quickest way to get started with the API is to use the <a
href="https://gds-payments.gelato.io/api-explorer/" target="blank">API
Explorer</a> [external link] with your API key.

1. Sign in to the API Explorer and select __Add API Key__.<br/><br/>
   ![](images/pay-add-api-key.png) <br/><br/>
2.  In the pop-up, enter the following values:

  * For __API Key__, enter your test API key. You do not need to add the
  `"Bearer:"` prefix, because the API Explorer adds that automatically.
  * For __Label__, enter `Authorization`.

  <span class="govuk-warning-text__icon" aria-hidden="true">!</span>
  <strong class="govuk-warning-text__text">
    <span class="govuk-warning-text__assistive">Warning</span>
    Do not use an API key from a live account on the GOV.UK Pay admin site. Only use a test API key

## Make a test API call

This section describes how to make a test API call to GOV.UK Pay, by creating
a new payment.  This is the same call your service will make when beginning a
payment using GOV.UK Pay.

1. Sign in to <a href="https://gds-payments.gelato.io/api-explorer/"
   target="blank">the API Explorer</a> [external link]
2. Under __Resource__, select __General__. Under __Action__, select <a
   href="https://gds-payments.gelato.io/api-explorer/gov-uk-pay-api/versions/1.0.2/general/create-new-payment"
   target="blank">__Create new payment__</a> [external link]. Select
   the __Body__ tab down to see an example JSON body that you would send when
   creating a payment.

```javascript
{
"amount": 12000,
"reference": "12345",
"description": "New passport application",
"return_url": "https://service-name.gov.uk/transactions/12345"
}
```

You also need to send a ``return_url`` when you create a payment. This is
because users go to pages hosted by GOV.UK Pay to actually
make payments.  The ``return_url`` is the URL of a page on your service
that the user will be redirected to after they have completed their payment
(or payment has failed).  <br/><br/>
![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/pay-govuk-documentation/pay-api-explorer-createpay.png)

Services that use test accounts can optionally use HTTP, rather than HTTPS,
for return URLs. You can read more about this in [the __Security__
section](/security/#https).

1. Select the green __Send Request__ button.

2. If the API Explorer is set up correctly, you will receive a `201 Created`
   response with a JSON body, confirming that the payment was created:

   ![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/pay-govuk-documentation/pay-api-explorer-response.png)

   The JSON includes a ``next_url`` link. This URL is where your service
   should redirect the user for them to make their payment.  <br/><br/>

## Simulate an end-user payment journey

Go to the ``next_url`` with a browser, and youâ€™ll see the payment screen.
Choose a mock card number from the [__Testing GOV.UK__
Pay](/testing_govuk_pay/#mock-card-numbers-for-testing-purposes) section and
enter it to simulate a payment in the test environment. For the other
required details, enter some test information which should have:

  * an expiry date that is in the future and in the format MM/YYYY
  * a valid postcode

Submit the payment.

## View transactions at GOV.UK Pay admin site

Go to the [GOV.UK Pay admin
site](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/). From the landing page,
select __Transactions__:

![](images/transaction+list+image+4.png)

Enter search criteria to find transactions using the available filters.
