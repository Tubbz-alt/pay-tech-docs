# Before you switch to live

Before you start taking live payments, you should:

* have a signed MOU or contract with GOV.UK Pay

* [provide organisation information](#provide-organisation-name-and-address) to GOV.UK Pay

* request a [live GOV.UK Pay account](#request-a-live-gov-uk-pay-account)

* make sure that the right people on your
team [know how to report an emergency](#emergency-contact-details)

GOV.UK Pay currently supports live gateways for the payment service providers (PSPs)
[ePDQ](/switching_to_live/set_up_a_live_epdq_account),
[Smartpay](/switching_to_live/set_up_a_live_smartpay_account) and
[Worldpay](/switching_to_live/set_up_a_live_worldpay_account).

GOV.UK Pay also supports a live gateway for Stripe.

How you switch to live differs depending on whether you use Stripe or another PSP.

## Provide organisation name and address

You provide the same information regardless of whether you are a Stripe or non-Stripe user.

Card networks require organisation information to be displayed on payment
pages. Before you make an account live, you must provide this information
to GOV.UK Pay.

1. Sign in to your [GOV.UK Pay
   account](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/login).

1. Select __My services__.

1. For the test account you want to make live, select __Organisation
   details__.

1. Complete the __Name__ and __Address__ fields.

1. Select __Save__.

> Make sure the organisation is the entity that has a contract with the
> payment service provider.

## Request a live GOV.UK Pay account

Requesting a live account is the same regardless of whether you are a Stripe or non-Stripe user.

1. Go to the [Request a live account](https://pay-admin.cloudapps.digital/request-to-go-live) page on GOV.UK Pay and select __Start now__.

1. Enter the name of your organisation and select __Continue__.

1. Choose how you will process payments and select __Continue__.

1. Select the __Accept legal terms__ checkbox and select __Continue__.

You will see the __Request submitted__ page. GOV.UK Pay will email you a link to your live account within one working day.

When your account is live, it will appear in the __My services__ page labelled as a __Live card account__.

## Complete your information

The information you provide differs depending on whether you use Stripe or another PSP.

### Stripe

GOV.UK Pay will contact you to verify your identity. You must provide GOV.UK Pay with your:

- bank sort code and account number
- responsible person's name, date of birth and home address
- organisation's address and telephone number if you have not already [provided this information](#provide-organisation-name-and-address)
- VAT number
- [company registration number](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/companies-house) (CRN)

GOV.UK only stores your organisation's address and telephone number. GOV.UK Pay passes all other information to Stripe without storing that information. Stripe then processes and stores that information.

### Non-Stripe PSP

Refer to the following GOV.UK Pay documentation to see what information you must provide to your PSP:

- [ePDQ](/switching_to_live/set_up_a_live_epdq_account/#set-up-live-gov-uk-pay-credentials)
- [Smartpay](/switching_to_live/set_up_a_live_smartpay_account/#set-up-credentials-on-gov-uk-pay)
- [Worldpay](/switching_to_live/set_up_a_live_worldpay_account/#set-up-your-profile)

## Support

Before you switch to live, you may find it helpful to read about the [support
the GOV.UK Pay team provides](/support_contact_and_more_information/#support).

While GOV.UK Pay is in beta, our team can provide hands-on support to you as you
make your service live if you require it.

### Emergency contact details

Before you switch to live, make sure your team knows
how to report an emergency.

In the event of an emergency, first check the [status
page](https://payments.statuspage.io). Select __Subscribe to updates__ to get
email notifications whenever GOV.UK Pay creates or updates an incident.

When you sign up for GOV.UK Pay, the team will give you emergency contact
details. You can use these to reach the appropriate support team in case of an
urgent problem. For example, if you suspect that fraudulent transactions are
being made on your account.
