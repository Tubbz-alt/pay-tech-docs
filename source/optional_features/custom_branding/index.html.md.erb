# Add custom branding

GOV.UK Pay supports custom branding on your payment journey.

You can use custom branding regardless of whether you [integrate your service](/integrate_with_govuk_pay/#how-to-integrate-with-the-gov-uk-pay-api) with GOV.UK Pay, or use [payment links](https://www.payments.service.gov.uk/govuk-payment-pages/).

You can apply custom branding to your [payment pages](/payment_flow/#making-a-payment) and your [payment confirmation emails](/payment_flow/#confirmation-email).

You cannot have different custom branding for payment pages and emails.

For the payment pages and emails, you can customise:

* the logo displayed in the left-hand or right-hand side of the top banner
* the background colour of the top banner

For payment pages only, you can also customise the border colour of the top banner.

The following images of the payment page and confirmation email show:

* where these customisable features are on the screen
* an example of how these features would look

<%= image_tag "/images/custom-branding-diagram-large.svg", { :alt => '' } %>

[Contact the GOV.UK Pay team](/support_contact_and_more_information/#contact-us) to request customisation of these features.

You must tell us which service you want to apply custom branding to. Custom branding applies to the test and live environments for a service.

## Customise your banner logo

To customise your banner logo, email us an image of your desired custom banner logo. Your image should be:

* in PNG or SVG format
* 300 pixels or less in height
* 120 pixels or less in width
* at least double the size of the image as displayed on-screen
* cropped to leave minimal whitespace around the logo
* compressed (optimised for web)

If you follow these requirements, your image will look clear on both mobile and non-mobile displays.

## Customise your banner background and border colour

For payment pages, you can customise both the background and border colours of the top banner.

For payment confirmation emails, you can only customise the background colour of the top banner.

To customise these features, email us the appropriate [hexadecimal colour codes](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp).

## Tell your users how to contact you

When you ask GOV.UK Pay to set up custom branding on your [payment confirmation emails](/payment_flow/#confirmation-email), you must tell your users how to contact you.

You can do this using a reply-to email address or another way such as a contact form.

If you use a reply-to email address, this email address can be a monitored email inbox for your service, or an unmonitored email address with an automated response.

If you use an unmonitored automated email response, you should tell your users:

- that the email address is unmonitored
- how your users can contact your service

You can customise your email responses in the GOV.UK Pay admin tool using the `customParagraph` field in the payment receipt email template.

You cannot customise your refund email.
