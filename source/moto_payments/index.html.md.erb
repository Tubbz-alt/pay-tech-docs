# Take a payment over the phone (‘MOTO’ payments)

We can set up your GOV.UK Pay account so you can fill in GOV.UK Pay payment pages with your users’ details.

This means you can take payments:

- over the phone
- by post

These payments are also known as Mail Order / Telephone Order (MOTO) payments.

You can take MOTO payments if your payment service provider (PSP) is either Worldpay / Government Banking PSP or ePDQ.

You cannot take MOTO payments through a [payment link](https://www.payments.service.gov.uk/govuk-payment-pages/). [Contact us](/support_contact_and_more_information/#contact-us) if you'd like us to develop this feature.

## Set up MOTO payments

You can set up MOTO payments on either a test account or a live account.

### Add a new service to your account

Add a new service for MOTO payments to your account.

1. Sign in to your [GOV.UK Pay account](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/).
1. Go to __My services__ and select __Add a new service__.

### Get a MOTO payments merchant ID

Contact your PSP and ask for a new merchant ID for MOTO payments.

[Contact Government Banking](https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/government-banking-service-gbs) instead if you use them.

__DOES THIS NEED AMENDING???__

### Enable MOTO payments

[Contact GOV.UK Pay support](mailto:govuk-pay-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk) and we'll:

- review your [Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS) assessment](/security/#payment-card-industry-pci-compliance) to check you can take MOTO payments

When we've enabled MOTO payments in your service, you can take a MOTO payment.










# Take a payment over the phone (‘MOTO’ payments)

We can set up your GOV.UK Pay account so you can fill in GOV.UK Pay payment pages with your users’ details.

This means you can take payments:

- over the phone
- by post

These payments are also known as Mail Order / Telephone Order (MOTO) payments.

You cannot take MOTO payments if your payment service provider (PSP) is SmartPay.

You also cannot take MOTO payments through a [payment link](https://www.payments.service.gov.uk/govuk-payment-pages/) - [contact us](/support_contact_and_more_information/#contact-us) if you'd like us to develop this feature.

## If your PSP is Worldpay or ePDQ

If your PSP is Worldpay or ePDQ, you must first:

- [create a new GOV.UK Pay service](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/create-service/register) for MOTO payments
- contact your PSP and ask for a new merchant code for MOTO payments

[Contact Government Banking](https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/government-banking-service-gbs) instead if you use them.

## Set up your account

Email [govuk-pay-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk](mailto:govuk-pay-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk) and we'll:

- review your [Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS) assessment](/security/#payment-card-industry-pci-compliance) to check you can take payments over the phone and by post
- enable MOTO payments in your service

## Create a MOTO payment

Make sure you've collected your user's:

- card number
- card expiry date
- card security code
- name from their card
- email address - if you’ve [enabled collecting your users’ email addresses](/integrate_with_govuk_pay/#collecting-your-users-39-billing-addresses)

Follow these steps to create and complete the MOTO payment.

1. If your PSP is Worldpay or ePDQ, make sure you're using an API key from your MOTO service in [your services](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/my-services).

2. [Create a payment](/making_payments/#creating-a-payment) with the GOV.UK Pay API, and include `moto: true` in the request body.

3. Go to the `next_url` included in the body of the response to your API call.

4. Fill in your user’s information on the **Enter card details** page.

    The **Enter Card Details** page will not have a billing address field, even if you've enabled collecting billing addresses.

5. Confirm the payment on the **Confirm your payment** page.

    You will not need to do a 3D Secure confirmation.

## Hide users' card information

When taking payments over the phone, you can hide the following sensitive user card information from your service team staff:

- the full 16 digit card number
- the card verification value (cvv) or card verification code (cvc)

To hide or unhide this information, you must have admin permissions for your service.

This change takes immediate effect, so you should tell your service team staff before changing these settings.

1. Sign into the [GOV.UK Pay admin tool](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/). Make sure you are in the right service.
1. Go to __Settings__ and then __Security__.
1. Go to either __Hide card numbers__ or __Hide card security codes__ and select __Change__.
1. Select either __Hidden__ or __Visible__ and then __Save changes__.

## Create an online payment

After we enable MOTO payments in your account, you can still create payments where your user fills in their details themselves.

[Create a payment](/making_payments/#creating-a-payment) with the GOV.UK Pay API using:

- `moto: false` in the request body
- an API key from your normal service in [your services](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/my-services), if your PSP is Worldpay or ePDQ
