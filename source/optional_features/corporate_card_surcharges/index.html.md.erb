# Corporate card surcharges  

GOV.UK Pay supports adding a surcharge when a user pays with a corporate
credit or debit card. You can [contact GOV.UK Pay
support](/support_contact_and_more_information/#contact-us) to ask the team to
set this up for you. 

Each surcharge is a flat amount added to a payment, not a percentage. 

Different corporate surcharges are possible for 4 different types of card.
These are: 

* non-prepaid credit cards 
* non-prepaid debit cards
* corporate pre-paid credit cards
* corporate pre-paid debit cards 

GOV.UK Pay maintains a list of cards of all 4 types. When a user enters a card
number that matches one of these and a surcharge is applicable, GOV.UK Pay
will inform the user that a corporate surcharge of a certain amount will be
addded to the total. If the platform cannot determine the exact type of a card
being used, it will not apply a surcharge.

You can sign in to the [GOV.UK Pay admin
tool](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/login) to see the
payment amount and the surcharge amount listed separately. 

If a corporate surcharge is applied to a particular payment, you can see this
in API responses. The `"corporate_card_surcharge"` and `"total _amount"`
fields contain amounts in pence. 

If you issue a refund, you can optionally refund up to the full amount -
including the surcharge. You can also use the partial refund feature to only
refund the non-surcharge total. You can read more in the ("Refunding
payments")[/refunding_payments] section.
