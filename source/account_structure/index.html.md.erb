# Account structure 

If you have multiple services integrated, you can treat them separately or as
a combined single service within GOV.UK and your Payment Service Provider
(PSP). This gives 3 possible account configurations.

As an example, take 2 services called "parking permits" and "parking fines": 

### Type 1 (GOV.UK Pay separate, PSP separate)

"Parking permits" and "Parking fines" are considered as separate services in
both GOV.UK Pay and the PSP. 

This is the default configuration for services. 

In this setup, payments to services can go to separate bank accounts because
each service has a PSP account. 

### Type 2 (GOV.UK Pay combined, PSP combined)

"Parking permits" and "Parking fines" are considered as a single combined
service in GOV.UK Pay and in the PSP. 

You may want to use this configuration if you want to simplify the
administration of multiple services in GOV.UK Pay, and have them appear as a
single item on the end user's bank statement.  

In this setup, payments to services must go to the same bank account because
they are a single service in the PSP. 

### Type 3 (GOV.UK Pay separate, PSP combined)

"Parking permits" and "Parking fines" are considered as separate services in
GOV.UK Pay and as a single combined service in the PSP. 

You may want to use this configuration if you want to administrate multiple
services individually in GOV.UK Pay, but have them appear as a single item on
the end user's bank statement.  

In this setup, payments to services must go to the same bank account because
they are a single service in the PSP. 

## Editing GOV.UK Pay services 

Each service defined in GOV.UK Pay has its own API key. 

In GOV.UK Pay, within each service you can edit: 

Sign in to [the GOV.UK Pay admin
site](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/) and go to the __Settings__
page to change: 

* account credentials 
* 3D secure settings 
* the card types you accept 
* email notifications settings 

You can also change the name of a service, including as it appears on payment
pages. To do this, select __My services__ and then __Edit name__ for the
service name you want to change.  

## Editing PSP services 

Within each gateway account for the PSP, you can edit: 

* what appears on bank statement of your users 
* which of your bank accounts your revenue goes to

Contact your PSP to find out more.
