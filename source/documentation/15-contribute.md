# Contribute

GOV.UK Pay's main application code is public and freely available under an [MIT Licence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License) and the GOV.UK Pay team [codes in the open](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2012/10/12/coding-in-the-open/) in our [GitHub account](https://github.com/alphagov?q=pay-).

We are experimenting with taking in Open Source contributions from our live partner services and we hope to widen this further  after learning more about integrating outside contributions into our workflow.
