# Strong Customer Authentication

Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) makes online payments more secure for users and reduces fraud. SCA is part of the Payment Service Directive (PSD2).

You must implement SCA by:
- XX December 2020 if you take payments from the European Economic Area (EEA), defined as the European Union, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein
- XX September 2021 if you only take payments from within the UK

To implement SCA, you must set up 3D Secure 2 (3DS2) or 3D Secure (3DS) payment authentication.

3D Secure 2 (3DS2) adds an extra layer of identity confirmation before your user pays. You should implement 3DS2 if possible.

How you set up 3DS2 or 3DS payment authentication depends on which Payment Service Provider (PSP) you’re using.

## Set up SCA with Stripe

You do not need to do anything because we set up 3DS2 on your service by default.

## Set up SCA with Worldpay

Worldpay sends all transactions using 3DS2 or 3DS and does not apply any exemptions (LINK). Contact GOV.UK Pay to apply for exemptions for your transactions.

### Set up 3DS2 (3DS Flex)

You need your 3DS Flex credentials to set up your account.

Government Banking's contracted PSP is currently Worldpay. If you are a Government Banking customer, Government Banking will contact you to let you know when to enable 3DS Flex on your account.

If you have a direct contract with Worldpay that does not use Government Banking, Worldpay will send you your 3DS Flex credentials. Ask your Worldpay account manager if you do not have your credentials.

You must pay a fee to Worldpay to use 3DS Flex.

1. Select the account you want to set up on the My services page in the GOV.UK Pay admin tool.
1. In the settings, select the View link under 3D Secure.
1. Select On.
1. Copy your 3DS Flex details into the PSP settings in your GOV.UK Pay account.
1. Check your account still works by making a payment with a real payment card.

### Set up 3DS

1. Ask your Worldpay account manager to set up 3DS on your merchant code for all payments.
1. Once Worldpay have set up your merchant code, select the account you want to set up on the My services page in the GOV.UK Pay admin tool.
1. In the settings, select the View link under 3D Secure.
1. Select On.

## Set up SCA with ePDQ

1. Sign in to your ePDQ account.
1. Go to Configuration then Payment methods.
1. Select 3D Secure.
1. Check that 3DS is on.
1. In the GOV.UK Pay admin tool, go to your My services page, then select the account you want to set up
1. In the settings, select the View link under 3D Secure.
1. Select On.

___OR___

GOV.UK Pay has built the integration with 3DS2 for ePDQ. You do not need to make any changes to your integration. ePDQ does not apply any exemptions (LINK).

## Set up SCA with Smartpay

Smartpay does not support 3DS2. You can only enable 3DS.

1. Select the account you want to set up on the My services page in the GOV.UK Pay admin tool.
1. In the settings, select the View link under 3D Secure.
1. Select On.

You do not need to do anything in your Smartpay account.

## Exemptions to 3DS2

3DS2 does not apply to:

- transactions where either the merchant or payer is outside the EEA
- merchant initiated payments such as subscriptions
- telephone (MOTO) payments

The following payment types may be exempt from 3DS2 depending on your PSP:

- low value transactions, for example for those under £30
- low risk transactions when yout PSP has low fraud levels across its platform
- corporate payments, unless the corporate card is in the name of an individual
