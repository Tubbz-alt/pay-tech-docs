# GOV.UK Pay technical documentation

Use this technical documentation to find out how to:

- use the GOV.UK Pay API

[Contact us](/support_contact_and_more_information/#contact-us) if you have any questions or feedback.

## How much it costs

There's no charge to use the GOV.UK Pay API.

You'll still need to pay your payment service provider’s (PSP’s) transaction fees. If you use GOV.UK Pay's PSP, we'll automatically deduct the transaction fee from each payment.
