# Use your own payment failure pages

You can [contact us](/support_contact_and_more_information/#contact-us) to set
this feature up for your service.

If you do not use your own payment failure pages, users will see standard
GOV.UK Pay payment failure pages.

Terminal, unsuccessful payment states are:

* payment declined

* payment cancelled

* payment expired

* error (for example, technical error)

If you use this feature, GOV.UK Pay will immediately redirect the user to the
`return_url` when a payment reaches a terminal unsuccessful
state. You can [set the `return_url` manually for your service](/payment_flow//#making-a-payment) in the request
to the `POST /v1/payments` API call.

You should configure your service to query payments to determine what
payment failure states are from API responses. Once your service
knows the [state of a payment](/payment_flow/#check-the-status-of-a-payment), it should direct users appropriately. For
example if a user's payment expires, you may want your service to return the
user to the start of their payment journey.

Refer to the GOV.UK Pay <a
href="https://govukpay-api-browser.cloudapps.digital/" target="blank">API
browser</a> for more information on using the API.

In very rare cases, GOV.UK Pay is unable to redirect payments. You should
[contact us](/support_contact_and_more_information/#contact-us) if this
happens.

## Expired payments

If a user abandons a payment and it expires, GOV.UK Pay can only redirect the
user if they did not leave the payment screen. If the user tries to
continue their journey from the payment screen after their payment has
expired, they will be returned to the service.

their payment
journey](/making_payments/#when-a-user-does-not-complete-their-payment-journey).
