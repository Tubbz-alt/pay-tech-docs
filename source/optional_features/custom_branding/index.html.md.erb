# Custom branding of payment pages

GOV.UK Pay supports custom branding on all pages in your payment journey.

You can use custom branding regardless of whether you [integrate your service](/integrate_with_govuk_pay/#how-to-integrate-with-the-gov-uk-pay-api) with GOV.UK Pay, or use [payment links](/payment_links/#payment-links).

You can [contact the GOV.UK Pay
team](/support_contact_and_more_information/#contact-us) to request
customisation for the following features:

* the logo displayed in the left-hand side of the top banner

* the background and border colour of the top banner

* the branding of your payment confirmation email

## Banner logo

You should provide an image of your desired custom banner logo [to GOV.UK Pay
directly](/support_contact_and_more_information/#contact-us). Your image should be:

* in PNG or SVG format

* at least 2x the size of the image that will be displayed on-screen

* cropped to leave minimal whitespace around the logo

* compressed (optimised for web)

## Banner background and border colour

You can make a request for custom colours [to GOV.UK Pay
directly](/support_contact_and_more_information/#contact-us).

Colours are customised using hexadecimal representations.

## Reply-to email address

When you ask GOV.UK Pay to set up custom branding on your payment confirmation emails, you should specify a reply-to email address so your users can contact you.

This reply-to email address can be an email inbox for your service, or an automated response.
