# Take payments over the phone (‘MOTO’ payments)

We can set up your service so you can fill in GOV.UK Pay payment pages with your users’ details.

This means you can take payments:

- over the phone
- by post

These payments are also known as Mail Order Telephone Order (MOTO) payments.

After we set up your service, you'll no longer be able to create payments where users fill in their details themselves. [Create a separate service](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/my-services/create) if you need to do this.

You cannot take MOTO payments if your payment service provider (PSP) is SmartPay.

## Set up your account

[Contact us](/support_contact_and_more_information/#general-feedback) and we’ll:

- review your [Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS) assessment](https://docs.payments.service.gov.uk/security/#payment-card-industry-pci-compliance) to check you can take payments over the phone and by post
- enable MOTO payments in your service

## Creating MOTO payments

To complete a MOTO payment, you must collect the following from your user:

- card number
- card expiry date
- card security code
- name from their card
- email address - if you’ve [enabled collecting your users’ email addresses](/integrate_with_govuk_pay/#collecting-your-users-39-billing-addresses)

1. [Create a payment](/making_payments/#making-payments) with the GOV.UK Pay API, and include `moto: true` in the request body.

2. Go to the `next_url` included in the body of the response to your API call.

3. Fill in your user’s information on the **Enter card details** page.

4. Confirm the payment on the **Confirm your payment** page.
