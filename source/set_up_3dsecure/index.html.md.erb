# Set up Strong Customer Authentication (3DS1 and 3DS2)

Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) makes online payments more secure for users and reduces fraud. SCA is part of the Payment Service Directive 2 (PSD2).

You must implement SCA by:

- 31 December 2020 if you take payments from the European Economic Area (EEA), defined as the European Union, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein
- 14 September 2021 if you only take payments from within the UK

To implement SCA, you must set up 3D Secure 2 (3DS2) or 3D Secure 1 (3DS1) payment authentication.

How you set up 3DS2 or 3DS1 payment authentication depends on which Payment Service Provider (PSP) youâ€™re using.

## Set up SCA with Stripe

You do not need to do anything because we set up 3DS2 on your service by default.

Stripe automatically applies exemptions.

## Set up SCA with Worldpay

Worldpay sends all transactions using 3DS2 or 3DS1. 3DS Flex is the Worldpay product that enables 3DS2 payment authentication. You must pay a fee to Worldpay to use 3DS Flex.

Worldpay sends you your 3DS Flex credentials when you [go live](/switching_to_live/set_up_a_live_worldpay_account/#connect-your-live-account-to-worldpay).

Worldpay does not apply any exemptions. Contact GOV.UK Pay to apply for exemptions for your transactions.

### Set up 3DS2 (3DS Flex)

1. Select the account you want to set up on the __My services__ page in the GOV.UK Pay admin tool.
1. In __Settings__, make sure that 3D Secure is __On__.
1. In __Your PSP__, enter your 3DS Flex credentials.

<%= warning_text('If your credentials are wrong, you are not able to take payments.') %>

### Set up 3DS1

1. Ask your Worldpay account manager to set up 3DS on your merchant code for all payments.
1. Once Worldpay have set up your merchant code, select the account you want to set up on the __My services__ page in the GOV.UK Pay admin tool.
1. In the settings, select the __View__ link under 3D Secure.
1. Select __On__.

## Set up SCA with ePDQ

You do not need to do anything because we set up 3DS2 on your service by default.

ePDQ does not apply any exemptions.

## Set up SCA with Smartpay

Smartpay does not support 3DS2. You can only enable 3DS1.

1. Select the account you want to set up on the __My services__ page in the GOV.UK Pay admin tool.
1. In the settings, select the __View__ link under 3D Secure.
1. Select __On__.

You do not need to do anything in your Smartpay account.

Smartpay does not apply any exemptions.
