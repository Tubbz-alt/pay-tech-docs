# Account structure

Before you read this section, you may find it useful to read the [‘Reporting’ section](/reporting/#reporting).

GOV.UK Pay does not limit how many services you can integrate with it.

If you do integrate multiple services, you can treat them separately or as a
combined single service within GOV.UK and your payment service provider (PSP).
This gives 3 possible account configurations. These configurations allow you
to alter which bank accounts payments go to, and the names of services that
appear on your end users’ bank statements.

As an example, take 2 services called ‘parking permits’ and ‘parking fines’:

### Type 1 (GOV.UK Pay separate, PSP separate)

![``”``](/images/accountstructure_1.png)

‘Parking permits’ and ‘Parking fines’ are considered separate services by
both GOV.UK Pay and the PSP.

In this setup, payments to services can go to separate bank accounts because
each service has a PSP account.

### Type 2 (GOV.UK Pay combined, PSP combined)

![``”``](/images/accountstructure_2.png)

‘Parking permits’ and ‘Parking fines’ are considered a single combined
service by GOV.UK Pay and the PSP.

You may want to use this configuration if you want to simplify the
administration of multiple services in GOV.UK Pay. For example, if you do not need reporting at an individual service level. The services will appear in the same transactions list and CSV file. You may find it useful to use unique reference numbers to separate payments clearly, for example “parkingfine_1234” and “parkingpermit_1234”.

In this configuration, payments to services must go to the same bank account because
they are a single service in the PSP. It is not possible to support multiple PSP accounts in a single GOV.UK Pay service.

### Type 3 (GOV.UK Pay separate, PSP combined)

![``”``](/images/accountstructure_3.png)

‘Parking permits’ and ‘Parking fines’ are considered separate services by
GOV.UK Pay and as a single combined service in the PSP.

You may want to use this configuration if you want to administrate multiple
services individually in GOV.UK Pay. For example, if you want separate reporting for each service, or different service names on the payment pages.

In this configuration, payments to services must go to the same bank account because
they are a single service in the PSP.

## Editing GOV.UK Pay services

Each service defined in GOV.UK Pay has its own API key.

Sign in to [the GOV.UK Pay admin
site](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/) and go to the __Settings__
page to change:

* account credentials
* 3D Secure settings
* the card types you accept
* email notifications settings

You can also change the name of a service, including how it appears on payment
pages. To do this, select __My services__ and then __Edit name__ for the
service name you want to change.

## Editing PSP services

Within each gateway account for the PSP, you can edit:

* what appears on the end user’s bank statement
* which of your bank accounts your revenue goes to

You should contact your PSP to find out more.
