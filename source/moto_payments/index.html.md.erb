Worldpay / epdq process

- you must have a moto merchant id, there is a 121 relationshipfor merchant id to service,
so you need a separate moto service in pay attached to a moto merchant id
- you must also attach the moto true flag in the api create payment call to signify that it is a moto payment
- worldpay = current govt banking contracted psp




STRIPE process

- can take moto payments and online payments using the same merchant id
- don't need to set up separate service for moto payments if using STRIPE
- so stripe treats payments in right way, you need to tell gov.uk pay in the api call whether it is a moto or online payment - moto true flag


if you want to test out moto, you don't need pci dss compliance for test account, but we will need to see it before enabling it on a live account

you do not need the merchant ID on the test account - applies for govt banking psp or epdq, could say worldpay for simplicity

link to going live content for info on psps

you must email pay to enable moto payments, if test then we just enable it, if live then we need pci dss compliance and merchant id if worldpay or ePDQ



test - all you need to do is request that the feature is enabled,
live - more requirements, and split worldpay/epdq vs stripe

moto payment screens are the same as online payment screeen, however moto screens do not have a section for billing address,
and SCA does not apply to moto






# Take a payment over the phone (‘MOTO’ payments)

We can set up your GOV.UK Pay account so you can fill in GOV.UK Pay payment pages with your users’ details.

This means you can take payments:

- over the phone
- by post

These payments are also known as Mail Order / Telephone Order (MOTO) payments.

You cannot take MOTO payments if your payment service provider (PSP) is Smartpay.

You cannot take MOTO payments through a [payment link](https://www.payments.service.gov.uk/govuk-payment-pages/). Our product roadmap is based on feedback. [Contact us](/support_contact_and_more_information/#contact-us) if you'd like us to develop this feature.




## Set up MOTO payments

You can set up MOTO payments on either a test account or a live account.

### Add a new service to your account

Add a new service for MOTO payments to your account.

worldpay/ePDQ vs stripe

1. Sign in to your [GOV.UK Pay account](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/).
1. Go to __My services__ and select __Add a new service__.

### Get a MOTO payments merchant ID

worldpay/ePDQ vs stripe

Contact your PSP and ask for a new merchant ID for MOTO payments.

[Contact Government Banking](https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/government-banking-service-gbs) instead if you use them.

__DOES THIS NEED AMENDING???__
__WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THE MERCHANT ID???__ same as go live process - connect service to psp and enter merchant id as part of that process

### Enable MOTO payments

send us self assessment questionnaire and service name, and then we'll review your pci dss compliance. Your compliance responsibilities are different with moto payments compared to online payments.

[Contact GOV.UK Pay support](mailto:govuk-pay-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk) and we'll:

- review your [Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS) assessment](/security/#payment-card-industry-pci-compliance) to check you can take MOTO payments
- enable MOTO payments in your service

__IS THE ACTION TO SEND INFORMATION ON PCI DSS COMPLIANCE OR DOES THE PAY TEAM DO THIS JUST BECAUSE OF THE EMAIL?__

When we've enabled MOTO payments in your service, you can take a MOTO payment.

## If your PSP is Worldpay or ePDQ

If your PSP is Worldpay or ePDQ, you must first:

- [create a new GOV.UK Pay service](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/create-service/register) for MOTO payments
- contact your PSP and ask for a new merchant code for MOTO payments

[Contact Government Banking](https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/government-banking-service-gbs) instead if you use them.

## Set up your account

Email [govuk-pay-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk](mailto:govuk-pay-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk) and we'll:

- review your [Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS) assessment](/security/#payment-card-industry-pci-compliance) to check you can take payments over the phone and by post
- enable MOTO payments in your service

## Create a MOTO payment

Follow these steps to create and complete the MOTO payment.

1. If your PSP is Worldpay or ePDQ, make sure you're using an API key from your MOTO service in [your services](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/my-services).

2. [Create a payment](/making_payments/#creating-a-payment) with the GOV.UK Pay API, and include `moto: true` in the request body.

3. Go to the `next_url` included in the body of the response to your API call.

4. Fill in your user’s information on the **Enter card details** page.

    The **Enter Card Details** page will not have a billing address field, even if you've enabled collecting billing addresses.

5. Confirm the payment on the **Confirm your payment** page.

    You will not need to do a 3D Secure confirmation.

If you're taking a payment by post, make sure you've collected your user's:

  - card number
  - card expiry date
  - card security code
  - name from their card
  - email address - if you’ve [enabled collecting your users’ email addresses](/integrate_with_govuk_pay/#collecting-your-users-39-billing-addresses)

## Hide users' card information

When taking payments over the phone, you can hide the following sensitive user card information from your service team staff:

- the full 16 digit card number
- the card verification value (cvv) or card verification code (cvc)

To hide or unhide this information, you must have admin permissions for your service.

This change takes immediate effect, so you should tell your service team staff before changing these settings.

1. Sign into the [GOV.UK Pay admin tool](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/). Make sure you are in the right service.
1. Go to __Settings__ and then __Security__.
1. Go to either __Hide card numbers__ or __Hide card security codes__ and select __Change__.
1. Select either __Hidden__ or __Visible__ and then __Save changes__.

## Create an online payment

After we enable MOTO payments in your account, you can still create payments where your user fills in their details themselves.

[Create a payment](/making_payments/#creating-a-payment) with the GOV.UK Pay API using:

- `moto: false` in the request body
- an API key from your normal service in [your services](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/my-services), if your PSP is Worldpay or ePDQ
