# Digital wallets

You can enable [Google Pay](https://pay.google.com/intl/en_uk/about/) and [Apple Pay](https://www.apple.com/uk/apple-pay/) [external links] to take payments from your users.

This is an invitation-only feature. [Contact the GOV.UK Pay team](https://docs.payments.service.gov.uk/support_contact_and_more_information/#contact-us) to request this feature for your service. After GOV.UK Pay has approved your request to participate in the private beta for Apple Pay and Google Pay, you will receive an email with a link to enable them. 

You can only enable Google Pay and Apple Pay if you have a [live Worldpay account](/switching_to_live/set_up_a_live_worldpay_account/#set-up-a-live-worldpay-account).

## Enable Apple Pay

Sign in to the [GOV.UK Pay admin tool](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/).

1. Click on the link in the email from GOV.UK Pay 

1. Select __Enable__ next to Apple Pay.

1. On the __Enable Apple Pay__ screen, select __Yes, turn on Apple Pay__.

## Enable Google Pay

To enable Google Pay, you must enter a unique Google Pay merchant ID into your GOV.UK Pay account.

You get your Google Pay merchant ID from your Worldpay merchant admin interface.

1. If required, speak to your Worldpay account manager to upgrade your Worldpay merchant admin interface, so that the interface has Google Pay functionality.

1. Sign in to your [Worldpay merchant admin interface](https://secure.worldpay.com/sso/public/auth/login.html) [external link].

1. Go to __Integration__ and select the __Pay with Google__ tab.

1. Under __Generate unique merchant ID__, select __Generate__.

1. Copy the generated merchant ID.

Sign in to the [GOV.UK Pay admin tool](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/).

1. Click on the link in the email from GOV.UK Pay 

1. Select __Enable__ next to Google Pay.

1. On the __Enable Google Pay__ screen, select __Yes, turn on Google Pay__.

1. Enter the generated merchant ID and select __Submit__.

## 3D Secure

A user making a digital wallet transaction must complete 3D secure authentication on that transaction if:

* that transaction needs 3D Secure authentication
* that user has not enabled biometric authentication on their digital wallet

Apple Pay has biometric authentication enabled by default, so users should not have to complete 3D Secure authentication during Apple Pay transactions.

Google Pay does not have biometric authentication enabled by default. 

## Restrictions

The GOV.UK Pay platform cannot apply [corporate card surcharges](/optional_features/corporate_card_surcharges/#corporate_card_surcharges) to digital wallet transactions made with a corporate card.

When you look at individual non-digital wallet transaction in your GOV.UK Pay account transactions list, you see the first six digits and last four digits of the card number. When you look at individual digital wallet transactions in your GOV.UK Pay account transactions list, you will only see the last 4 digits of the card number or device account number.

### Google Pay

You can restrict Google Pay digital wallet transactions by card scheme, but not by card type. For example, you can state that you only accept digital wallet transactions made with Visa cards, but you cannot only accept these transactions made with a debit card.
