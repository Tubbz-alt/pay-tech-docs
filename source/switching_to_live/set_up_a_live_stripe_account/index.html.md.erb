# Connect your live account to Stripe

First make sure you've:

- read about [what to do first](/switching_to_live/#before-you-start)
- [requested a live GOV.UK Pay account](http://localhost:4567/switching_to_live/#1-request-a-live-gov-uk-pay-account)

We'll then contact you to verify your organisation’s identity.

We'll also give you a link where you can provide your organisation's:

* bank sort code and account number
* address
* telephone number
* VAT number
* [company registration number](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/companies-house) if you have one

You must also provide us with the name, date of birth and home address of someone who's authorised to sign contracts on behalf of your organisation, also known as a ‘responsible person’.

GOV.UK only stores your organisation's address and telephone number. GOV.UK Pay passes all other information to Stripe without storing that information. Stripe then processes and stores that information.
