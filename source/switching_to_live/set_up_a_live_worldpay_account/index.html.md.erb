# Connect your live account to Worldpay

Before you start, you must:

- read about [what to do first](/switching_to_live/#before-you-start)
- [request a live GOV.UK Pay account](http://localhost:4567/switching_to_live/#1-request-a-live-gov-uk-pay-account)

You must also be an admin on your GOV.UK Pay account.

## Check your Worldpay account

Make sure your Worldpay account is both:

- an admin account
- using the Worldpay Corporate Gateway

GOV.UK Pay does not support the Worldpay Business Gateway.

## Select your merchant code

Sign in to your [Worldpay
account](https://secure.worldpay.com/sso/public/auth/login.html) and select your merchant code.

If __Test Mode__ is at the bottom of the left-hand menu, switch to __Production Mode__. Worldpay uses the term 'production' for live accounts.

## Copy your credentials into GOV.UK Pay

You must copy your details from your Worldpay account to your GOV.UK Pay live account.

1. Sign in to the [__Your PSP - Worldpay__](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/your-psp) screen of the GOV.UK admin tool. Make sure you've selected your live account, not your test account.

2. In your Worldpay account, select __Account__, then the __Profile__ tab. Select your merchant code if you're asked for one.

3. Copy the __Merchant Code__ value from the __Identification__ section of your Worldpay account into the __Merchant code__ field in your GOV.UK Pay account.

4. Copy the __New Username__ value into the __Username__ field.

5. If you see a checkbox labelled __Disable Original XML Username__, select the checkbox then
select __Save Profile__ at the bottom.

6. If you have not set your XML password for this merchant code before, set it by selecting the pencil icon next to __XML Password__ and choosing a password. Confirm by selecting __Add new password__, then __OK__. Save the password by selecting the pencil icon again, then __Complete__, then __OK__.

    > If you've set your XML password before but you cannot remember it, you can set a new password. But you must add the new password to your other GOV.UK Pay services.

7. Enter your XML password into the __Password__ field in your GOV.UK Pay live account.

8. In the __Payment service__ section of your Worldpay account, set __Capture delay (days)__ to __Off__ (not __0__). If you do not do this, you may take money from your users before they've confirmed their payment.

9. In your GOV.UK Pay account, select __Save credentials__.

## Set up your Worldpay 'Merchant Channels'

You must set up your Worldpay 'Merchant Channels' so Worldpay can notify GOV.UK Pay about payment events.

Sign in to your [Worldpay
account](https://secure.worldpay.com/sso/public/auth/login.html). Select __Integration__, then the __Merchant Channel__ tab.

### Merchant Channels

You must make the following changes in both the __Merchant Channels (Production)__ and __Merchant Channels (Test)__ sections.

Set __Active__ to:

- __no__ in the __email__ row
- __yes__ in the __http__ row
- __no__ in the __shopper email__ row

In the __http__ row, set:

- __Content__ to __xml__
- __Address__ to `https://notifications.payments.service.gov.uk/v1/api/notifications/worldpay`
- __Method__ to __POST__
- __Client certificate__ to __no__

### Merchant Channel Events

In both the __Merchant Channel Events (Production)__ and __Merchant Channel Events (Test)__ sections, select the following:

- __SHOPPER_REDIRECTED__
- __SENT_FOR_AUTHORISATION__
- __AUTHORISED__
- __ERROR__
- __CANCELLED__
