# Before you start

To start using the GOV.UK Pay platform, you'll need:

 - a new or existing digital service that needs to take payments
 - people with the development skills to build the technical integration with GOV.UK Pay
 - your own PSP contracts for gateway and merchant acquirer services (there are existing cross-government contracts offering competitive transaction costs that may be available to you - please email us at [govuk-pay-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk](mailto:govuk-pay-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk) if you’d like to discuss contractual questions)
 - points of contact to communicate with the GOV.UK Pay team - this is likely to be your service’s product owner or service manager, as well as a technical lead

Make sure you’re also familiar with the government guidance on [deploying new software](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/making-software/deployment.html).

>If you are new to the GOV.UK Pay API, we recommend you take a look at the quick start guide, which explains how to access the API and start exploring what it can do.
