# Account structure 

If you have multiple services integrated with GOV.UK Pay, you can treat them
differently at each level (service, GOV.UK Pay, and PSP).

For example, if you had services for parking permits and parking fines, you
could have these treated individually at your service level, but have them be
treated as part of the same service at the GOV.UK Pay level (e.g. "Parking
service") level). You could also have them be treated separately or as part of
the same service at the PSP level. How they are treated at the PSP level
determines what appears on the user's bank statement.  

Within each service you can edit: 

* user permissions 
* email template to user
* accepted card types
* name that appears on the payment pages 
* accept 3DS 

Each service defined in GOV.UK Pay has its own API.

Within each service on GOV.UK Pay, you can edit: 

* what appears on bank statement of your users 
* which of your bank accounts your revenue goes to

integration:
