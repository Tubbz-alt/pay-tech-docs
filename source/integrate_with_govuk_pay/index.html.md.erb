# How to integrate with the GOV.UK Pay API

Before you build an integration, your service team should have the necessary skills. You can refer to the [GOV.UK Service Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/the-team/what-each-role-does-in-service-team#roles-your-team-must-have) for more information.

This guidance is for technical architects or developers planning to integrate
their service with the GOV.UK Pay API. It describes:

* the requirements for your service’s backend
* what data you need to store and why
* typical data flows for using the GOV.UK Pay API in an integration
* when to release payments to users
* making sure that all payments are processed
* integrating with finance and accounting systems (see also [__Reporting__](/reporting))

The following diagram shows a typical high-level architecture with a GOV.UK
Pay integration:

## Service backend

Your service backend is server-side software. You should build this to:

* make a call to the GOV.UK Pay API to start the payment journey
* store information about user payment journeys in your datastore
* redirect the user to the `next_url` provided by GOV.UK Pay, where the user
will [enter their payment information and confirm their payment](/payment_flow/#making-a-payment)
* receive users’ requests when they are redirected back to your service via
the `return_url`, where the user will return [after completing payment](/payment_flow/#making-a-payment)
* identify the returning user via the session
* make a call to the GOV.UK Pay API to determine the outcome of the payment
* display information about the outcome of the payment and next steps to
the user

## Datastore

You will likely need some kind of server-side datastore to record payment information for each payment journey. You should store the:

* an ID or primary key
* the service the user requested
* the GOV.UK Pay `paymentId`
* the status of the payment
* the date and time the payment was started

## Finance and accounting systems

You may want to integrate your finance and accounting systems with GOV.UK Pay
using the API.

For example, you could automatically fetch data about the outcome of payment journeys. You could import that into your finance system so payments can be reconciled against bank transaction information.

You could also connect a customer-relationship management (CRM) or case management system to GOV.UK Pay, so your staff can issue refunds from within your system.

You can read more in the [__Reporting__](/reporting) and
[__Refunding payments__](/refunding_payments) sections of this documentation.

## The GOV.UK Pay API

The GOV.UK Pay API offers a set of operations to conduct and report on
payments. See the [__API reference__](/api_reference) section
of this documentation for more information or use the interactive [API
explorer](https://gds-payments.gelato.io/api-explorer/) [external link].

## When to release your service to users

It's your responsibility to decide when to release your service to
users. This will depend on the nature of your service.

In some cases you may be comfortable releasing a service before a payment
has been confirmed. For example, if you’re taking payments in advance because a user has an account with you.

In most cases, you’ll want to confirm that a payment has been completed before releasing the service to users. Typically you’ll do this
when the user visits the `return_url` on your service.

The following example UML sequence diagram shows a typical happy-path payment journey:

## Identifying the user when they return to your service

We recommend using a cookie-based session to identify the user when they
return to your service. You could use either encrypted client side sessions,
or server-side sessions using session store.

We recommend that you do not encode any reference number or user-
specific information in the `return_url`.

If you do, an attacker may be able to guess the reference in your
`return_url` and gain access to another user's personal information displayed
on your confirmation screen.

|      | Example |
|------|---------|
| Good | `https://my.service.gov.uk/return` |
| Bad  | `https://my.service.gov.uk/return/payment_12345` |

You must use [HTTPS](/security/#https) for your `return_url`.

## Make sure that all payments are processed

There are 2 failure cases which affect the design of your integration with
GOV.UK Pay:

* user abandons their payment journey before completing it
* user completes their payment successfully, but their network connection is
interrupted before they return to your service

In the happy-path scenario you want to release your service as quickly as
possible to your user, so you would check the payment outcome when your
`return_url` is visited.

However, in the failure cases, users will never visit the `return_url`. Instead, you should either:

* make sure your service team can manually check payment outcomes in the [GOV.UK Pay admin tool](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/login)
* use an automatic mop-up job (recommended)

### Have your service team manually check the payment outcome

If your team manually checks payment outcomes before releasing payments to users, you may have a low-volume service. This
would always be the case if you are using [payment links](/payment_links).

You should make sure your service staff check the outcomes of
payments in the GOV.UK Pay admin tool before releasing the service to the user.

### Use an automatic mop-up job (recommended)

A ‘mop-up job’ provides the best guarantee that the failure cases are handled properly
and automatically. A mop-up job is a background process which checks the outcome of incomplete payment journeys.

In order to use a mop-up job, you need:

* a datastore which keeps track of incomplete payment journeys
* a server-side process which periodically checks the datastore for incomplete payment journeys, and queries the GOV.UK Pay API to determine the outcome

The following UML sequence diagram shows an example of an incomplete payment journey, and how a mop-up job would clean it up:

![A mop-up job acting on an incomplete payment journey](/images/incomplete-payment-journey-sequence.svg)

Your mop-up job should run frequently, for example every half an hour. It should ignore payments made in the past 3 hours to avoid interfering with payments that are still being processed. If it finds ‘stale’ incomplete payment journeys then it’s likely users have abandoned those payments. The mop-up job should call the GOV.UK Pay API to determine the [status of the payment](/api_reference/#payment-status-lifecycle).
