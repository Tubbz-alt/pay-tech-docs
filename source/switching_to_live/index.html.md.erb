# Go live

You must follow this guidance to go live if you're either:

- integrating with the GOV.UK Pay API
- using [payment links](/payment_links/#payment-links)

[Contact us](/support_contact_and_more_information/) if you need help.

## Before you start

You must:

- subscribe to updates on the [GOV.UK Pay status page](https://payments.statuspage.io), so you get a notification when there's an incident
- know how to [contact us](/support_contact_and_more_information/) to report an emergency
- have successfully finished [testing your integration using your test account](/testing_govuk_pay/#testing-your-integration)
- have a secure domain for your service, because you must use HTTPS for the `return_url` when you [create a payment](/making_payments/#creating-a-payment) for a live service

Live accounts have a slower response time than test accounts, because GOV.UK Pay must wait for responses from your payment service provider (PSP).

## 1. Request a live GOV.UK Pay account

You will need to tell us:

- your organisation's name and address
- if you’ll be using GOV.UK Pay’s PSP Stripe, or your own

Sign in to the [GOV.UK Pay admin tool](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/) and select __Request a live account__.

Within one working day, we'll email you with:

- a link to your new live account
- emergency contact details so you can tell us if there's an urgent problem, for example fraudulent payments on your account

Your live account will appear on your [__My services__ page](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/my-services) in the GOV.UK Pay admin tool, labelled __Live card account__.

You can still use your test account.

## 2. Connect your live account to your PSP

Once you have a GOV.UK Pay account live account, connect it to:

- [Stripe](/switching_to_live/set_up_a_live_stripe_account/#set-up-a-live-stripe-account)
- [ePDQ](/switching_to_live/set_up_a_live_epdq_account/#set-up-your-live-epdq-account)
- [Smartpay](/switching_to_live/set_up_a_live_smartpay_account/#set-up-your-live-smartpay-account)
- [Worldpay](/switching_to_live/set_up_a_live_worldpay_account/#connect-your-live-account-to-worldpay)

## 3. Choose which card types to accept

Choose which card types to accept by:

- [signing in to the GOV.UK Pay admin tool](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/payment-types) if you use Stripe or Worldpay
- contacting your Smartpay or ePDQ account manager if you use SmartPay or ePDQ

### If you use Worldpay

If you use Worldpay and you want to accept American Express cards, you must contact either:

- Government Banking - if your Worldpay contract is through Government Banking
- your Worldpay account manager

You must send your American Express merchant ID to Government Banking or Worldpay if you’re a non-Crown merchant.

## 4. Set up 3D Secure (3DS)

1. If you use Worldpay, ask your Worldpay account manager to enable 3D Secure for your merchant code.

2. Sign in to your [GOV.UK Pay account settings](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/settings/) and turn on 3D Secure.
3. If you use ePDQ, sign in [your ePDQ account](https://payments.epdq.co.uk/Ncol/Prod/BackOffice/login/index) and select __Configuration__, then  __Payment methods__, then check __3D Secure__ is on.

## 5. Check your live account works

1. Select your live service from your [__My services__ page](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/my-services) in the GOV.UK pay admin tool.

2. Select __Settings__, then __API keys__. Generate an API key.

3. Use the new live API key to test making a real payment on your live account, using the [GOV.UK Pay API](/making-a-payment) or a [payment link](/payment_links). You must use a real card. Use a small amount, because GOV.UK Pay will take the payment from the card you use.

4. After you've confirmed the payment, check you received a [confirmation email](/payment_flow/#confirmation-email).

5. Check the payment appears in [your transactions](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/transactions) in the GOV.UK admin tool.

6. Select the payment and check you can refund it. It may take up to 20 minutes for the __Refund payment__ button to appear.

If your payment or refund fails, check:

- [your PSP settings](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/your-psp) are correct
- you [connected your live account to your PSP](#2-connect-your-live-account-to-your-psp) correctly
