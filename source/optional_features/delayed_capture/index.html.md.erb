# Delayed capture

You can control how long it takes for GOV.UK Pay to transfer ('capture') a payment from a user's bank account.

You may want to use delayed capture if you need time to do your own anti-fraud checks on payments, or check that users are eligible for your service.

To use this feature, include `"delayed_capture": true` in the body of a <a
href="https://govukpay-api-browser.cloudapps.digital/#newpayment"
target="blank">Create new payment</a> request [external link].

The user experience matches the current payment flow. Once the user selects
__Confirm__ on the __Confirm your details__ page, your service can call the
`POST /v1/payments/{paymentId}/capture` endpoint to send a delayed capture
request.

Refer to the <a
href="https://govukpay-api-browser.cloudapps.digital/#capturepayment"
target="blank">API browser</a> or the <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/pay-publicapi/blob/master/swagger/swagger.json" target="blank">Swagger file</a> for more information.

There are 4 possible responses:

<div style="height:1px;font-size:1px;">&nbsp;</div>

| Response Code  | Meaning                    |
| -------------- | -------------------------- |
|204             | Capture request accepted   |
|404             | `paymentId` does not exist |
|409             | Capture request rejected   |
|500             | Downstream error           |

<div style="height:1px;font-size:1px;">&nbsp;</div>

Your service must send the delayed capture request within 48 hours of the
payment creation, regardless of how long the user takes to complete the
payment flow. Otherwise, it will expire.

If your service has enabled payment receipt emails, GOV.UK Pay will send a
payment receipt email to the user once your serviceâ€™s capture request is
received and accepted.

## See the capture URL for a payment

If a payment is available for capture, you can see its capture URL in
responses to API calls. For example:

* `GET /v1/payments/{paymentID}`

* `GET /v1/payments`

The `"__links"` object will contain:`

```
"capture": {
"href": "https://publicapi.payments.service.gov.uk/v1/payments/<PAYMENT-ID>/capture",
    "method": "POST"
    }
```

If the payment is not available for capture, the `"__links"` object will
contain:

```
"capture": null
```
