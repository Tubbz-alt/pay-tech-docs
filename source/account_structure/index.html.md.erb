# Account structure

You can read more about [reporting](/reporting/#reporting).

GOV.UK Pay does not limit how many services you can integrate with it and how many accounts you can have with us.
GOV.UK Pay test and live accounts are free to create and maintain but your payment service provider may charge you for the underlying accounts.

## Account structure examples

If you do integrate multiple services, you can treat them separately or as a
combined single service within GOV.UK Pay and your payment service provider (PSP).
This gives 3 possible account configurations.

As an example, take 2 services called ‘parking permits’ and ‘parking fines’:

### Type 1 (GOV.UK Pay separate, PSP separate)

![``”``](/images/accountstructure_1.svg)

‘Parking permits’ and ‘Parking fines’ are considered separate services by
both GOV.UK Pay and the PSP.

In this setup, payments to services can go to separate bank accounts because
each service has a PSP account.

You can:

- give access for each service to different staff members
- report separately on each of your services
- optionally use different names on the GOV.UK Pay payment pages

### Type 2 (GOV.UK Pay combined, PSP combined)

![``”``](/images/accountstructure_2.svg)

‘Parking permits’ and ‘Parking fines’ are considered a single combined
service by GOV.UK Pay and the PSP.

You may want to use this configuration if you want to simplify the
administration of multiple services in GOV.UK Pay. For example, if you do not need reporting at an individual service level. The transactions from both services will appear in the same transactions list and CSV file. You may find it useful to use reference numbers to separate payments clearly, for example “parking_fine_1234” and “parking_permit_1234”.

In this configuration, payments to services must go to the same bank account because
they are a single service in the PSP. It is not possible to support multiple PSP accounts in a single GOV.UK Pay service.

### Type 3 (GOV.UK Pay separate, PSP combined)

![``”``](/images/accountstructure_3.svg)

‘Parking permits’ and ‘Parking fines’ are considered separate services by
GOV.UK Pay and as a single combined service in the PSP.

You may want to use this configuration if you want to administrate multiple
services individually in GOV.UK Pay. For example, if you want separate reporting for each service, or different service names on the payment pages.
This option also allows you to give access for each service to different staff members.

In this configuration, payments for both services are settled to the same bank account because
they go into a single account in the PSP.

## Editing GOV.UK Pay services

Each service defined in GOV.UK Pay has its own API key.

Sign in to the [GOV.UK Pay admin
tool](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/) and go to the __Settings__
page to change:

* 3D Secure settings

* the card types you accept

* email notifications settings

* billing address settings

* account credentials

You can also change the name of a service, including how it appears on payment
pages. To do this, select __My services__ and then __Edit name__ for the
service name you want to change.

## Editing PSP services

Within each gateway account for the PSP, you can edit:

* what appears on your users' bank statements

* which of your bank accounts your revenue goes to

You should contact your PSP to find out more.
