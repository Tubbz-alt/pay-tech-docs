# Before you start

Before you start testing GOV.UK Pay, you should:

* read the ["Get started" guide](https://www.payments.service.gov.uk/getstarted/) and decided that GOV.UK Pay is right for your service
* sign up for [the GOV.UK Pay admin tool](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/create-service/register)
* read the government guidance on [deploying new software](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/making-software/deployment.html).

If you want to build a technical integration between your service and GOV.UK Pay, your service team should have the necessary skills. You can refer to the [Service Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/the-team/what-each-role-does-in-service-team#roles-your-team-must-have) for more information. This does not apply if you only use [payment links](/payment_links/#payment-links). 

## Sign up and test GOV.UK Pay 

  

>If you are new to the GOV.UK Pay API, we recommend you take a look at the quick start guide, which explains how to access the API and start exploring what it can do.

## How long will it take?

The time taken to integrate will vary depending on team and capability; for example, it took a single developer five days to integrate a Home Office service with GOV.UK Pay.

## Try the service out

You can try GOV.UK Pay before integrating with the API. 

You must be logged into a GOV.UK Pay __test__ account to try these features out.

### Make a demo payment

You can [try the payment experience as a user](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/make-a-demo-payment), and then view the completed payment as a GOV.UK Pay administrator.

### Test your service with your users 

You can [create a reusable link](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/test-with-your-users) to integrate your service prototype with GOV.UK Pay, and test with your users.
