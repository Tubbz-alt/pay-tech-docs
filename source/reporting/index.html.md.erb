# Reporting 

You can extract reporting information from GOV.UK Pay manually, or via the
API.

## Manual reporting

You can sign in to your [GOV.UK Pay admin
account](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/login) and export
transaction information in a CSV file. 

For a given account, select __Transactions__ in the __Dashboard__ page.

You can filter transactions using the available search criteria, and then
select __Download all transaction details as a CSV file__. 

You can process CSV files using spreadsheet software.

## Reporting via the GOV.UK Pay API 

Before reading this section, you should read the section describing [Making
payments](/making_payments). 

You can use the GOV.UK Pay API to export data automatically into your finance
systems. This requires you to do some development, but could remove 
routine manual operations from your workflow and lead to significant cost
savings for your organisation. Before you do this, you should have a datastore 
where you are already recording payments. 

You can use the GOV.UK Pay API to:

* get information about single payments
* generate a list of payments 

## Get information about single payments

### Check the status of a single payment

`GET /v1/payments/paymentId`

1. Sign in to <a href="https://gds-payments.gelato.io/api-explorer/"
   target="blank">the API Explorer</a> (link opens in new window).  
2. Under __Resource__, select __{Payment Id}. Under __Action__, select <a
   href="https://gds-payments.gelato.io/api-explorer/gov-uk-pay-api/versions/1.0.2/general/"
   target="blank">__Find payment by ID__</a> (link opens in new window). 
   
For a valid request, the JSON response body contains a `"state"` field. 

For example, for a successful payment:

```
  "state": {
    "status": "success",
    "finished": true
    },
```

### See information users have entered for a single payment

`GET /v1/payments/paymentId`

1. Sign in to <a href="https://gds-payments.gelato.io/api-explorer/"
   target="blank">the API Explorer</a> (link opens in new window).  
2. Under __Resource__, select __{Payment Id}. Under __Action__, select <a
   href="https://gds-payments.gelato.io/api-explorer/gov-uk-pay-api/versions/1.0.2/general/"
   target="blank">__Find payment by ID__</a> (link opens in new window). 

For a valid request, the JSON response body contains the `"card_details"`
section. This shows information that users enter when making a payment. 

For example:

```
  "card_details": {
    "last_digits_card_number": "1111",
    "first_digits_card_number": "100002",
    "cardholder_name": "Sherlock Holmes",
    "expiry_date": "12/21",
    "billing_address": {
      "line1": "221 Baker Street",
      "line2": "Flat b",
      "postcode": "NW16XE",
      "city": "London",
      "country": "GB"
    },
```

## Generate a list of payments (search payments) 

`GET /v1/payments`

1. Sign in to <a href="https://gds-payments.gelato.io/api-explorer/"

   href="https://gds-payments.gelato.io/api-explorer/gov-uk-pay-api/versions/1.0.2/general/"

You can search payments using the following criteria:

* `from_date`
* `to_date`
* `page`
* `display_size`
