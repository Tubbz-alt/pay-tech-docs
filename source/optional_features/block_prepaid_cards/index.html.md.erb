# Block prepaid cards

You can block users from paying with prepaid cards. You should only do this if users are making fraudulent payments with prepaid cards.

You cannot block most Mastercard prepaid cards, because we usually cannot tell if Mastercard cards are prepaid or not.

If you want to block Visa prepaid cards, you must register with Visa to get permission first. To register, either:

- [contact us](/support_contact_and_more_information/#contact-us) if you use Stripe
- contact your Payment Service Provider

[Contact us](/support_contact_and_more_information/#contact-us) to block prepaid cards on your account.
