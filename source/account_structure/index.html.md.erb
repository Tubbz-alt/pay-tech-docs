# Account structure 

If you have multiple services integrated, you can treat them separately or as
a combined single service. You can use the GOV.UK Pay platform to set this this within
GOV.UK Pay and within your Payment Service Provider (PSP). 

![Account structures diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alphagov/pay-tech-docs/account_structure/source/images/account_structure.png)

You may have 2 services, for example for parking permits and parking fines.
The diagram takes this example and illustrates the different possible
structures you can have:

### Type 1 (GOV.UK Pay separate, PSP separate)

"Parking permits" and "Parking fines" are considered as separate services in
both GOV.UK Pay and the PSP.

### Type 2 (GOV.UK Pay combined, PSP combined)

"Parking permits" and "Parking fines" are considered as a single combined
service in GOV.UK Pay and in the PSP.

### Type 3 (GOV.UK Pay separate, PSP combined)

"Parking permits" and "Parking fines" are considered as separate services in
GOV.UK Pay and as a single combined service in the PSP. 

## Editing GOV.UK Pay services 

Each service defined in GOV.UK Pay has its own API.

In GOV.UK Pay, within each service you can edit: 

* user permissions 
* email template to user
* accepted card types
* name that appears on the payment pages 
* accept 3DS 

## Editing PSP services 

Within each service for the PSP, you can edit: 

* what appears on bank statement of your users 
* which of your bank accounts your revenue goes to
