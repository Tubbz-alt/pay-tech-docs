# Take Direct Debit payments

You can sign up for Direct Debit pilot if you want to take recurring payments.

You can take payments whenever you need to. You can take the same amount or a different amount each time.

You cannot automatically schedule payments. If you need to take regular payments, you should create your own scheduler to send API calls on a set schedule.

Direct Debit is not currently available to central government departments in England or the NHS. [Contact us](/support_contact_and_more_information/#contact-us) if youâ€™d like to know more.
