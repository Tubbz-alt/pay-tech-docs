# Payment links 

You may want to use payment links rather than integrate with the GOV.UK Pay API if your service:

- is non-digital and uses paper applications to process payments
- is non-digital and has low transaction volumes
- asks users for payment by sending email or letters
- does not have a development team that can integrate your service with GOV.UK Pay

You can read more about payment links on [the product page](https://www.payments.service.gov.uk/payment-links/).
