# Connect your live account to Stripe

First make sure you've:

- read about [what to do first](/switching_to_live/#before-you-start)
- [requested a live GOV.UK Pay account](/switching_to_live/#1-request-a-live-gov-uk-pay-account)

We'll then contact you to verify your organisation’s identity.

We'll also give you a link where you can provide your organisation's:

* bank sort code and account number
* address
* telephone number
* VAT number
* company registration number if you've [registered your company](https://www.gov.uk/limited-company-formation/register-your-company)

You must also provide us with the name, date of birth and home address of someone who's authorised to sign contracts on behalf of your organisation, also known as a ‘responsible person’.

GOV.UK only stores your organisation's address and telephone number. GOV.UK Pay passes all other information to Stripe without storing that information. Stripe then processes and stores that information.
