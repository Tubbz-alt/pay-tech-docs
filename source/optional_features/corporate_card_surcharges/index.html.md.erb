# Corporate card surcharges  

GOV.UK Pay supports adding a surcharge when a user pays with a corporate
credit or debit card. You can [contact GOV.UK Pay
support](/support_contact_and_more_information/#contact-us) to ask the team to
set this up for you. 

Each surcharge is a flat amount added to a payment, not a percentage. 

You can set a different corporate surcharge for each of the following 4
corporate card types: 

* non-prepaid credit cards 
* non-prepaid debit cards
* prepaid credit cards
* prepaid debit cards 

When a user enters a card number in their payment journey, the GOV.UK Pay
platform checks it against the 4 corporate card types. If a surcharge is
applicable, GOV.UK Pay will inform the user that a corporate surcharge of a
certain amount will be added to the total. If the platform cannot determine
the exact type of a card being used, it will not apply a surcharge.

You can sign in to the [GOV.UK Pay admin
tool](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/login) [external link] to see the
payment amount and the surcharge amount listed separately. 

If a corporate surcharge is applied to a particular payment, you can see this
in API responses:

* the `"total_amount"` field contains the total amount including any surcharge
* the `"amount"` field contains the amount without any surcharge
* the `"corporate_card_surcharge"` field contains only the surcharge amount

All amounts are in pence.

If a payment has a surcharge applied, the full amount available for refund
includes the surcharge. You can also use the [partial refund
feature](/refunding_payments/#payment-refund-status-and-partial-refunds) to
only refund the total amount excluding the surcharge.
