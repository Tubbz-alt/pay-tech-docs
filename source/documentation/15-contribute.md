# Contribute

Currently GOV.UK Pay is not open source, but we’re planning to change that very soon. At the moment, we can invite developers from other service teams to collaborate with us.

We hope to soon invite everyone to be involved in our project, allowing you all to raise pull requests on Github and contribute to our code. Please stay tuned.

>If you’d like to speak to us about writing a developer library for GOV.UK Pay, we’d love to hear from you: please [email us](mailto:govuk-pay-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk)
