# Add custom branding

GOV.UK Pay supports custom branding on all pages in your payment journey.

You can use custom branding regardless of whether you [integrate your service](/integrate_with_govuk_pay/#how-to-integrate-with-the-gov-uk-pay-api) with GOV.UK Pay, or use [payment links](https://www.payments.service.gov.uk/govuk-payment-pages/).

You can [contact the GOV.UK Pay
team](/support_contact_and_more_information/#contact-us) to request
customisation for the following features:

* the logo displayed in the left-hand or right-hand side of the top banner
* the background and border colour of the top banner
* the branding of your payment confirmation email

You must tell us which service you want to apply custom branding to. Custom branding applies to the test and live environments for a service.

We recommend that you only enable custom branding once you have [gone live and started taking payments from real users](/switching_to_live/#go-live).

You cannot have different custom branding for payment pages and emails.

## Banner logo

You should [email us](/support_contact_and_more_information/#contact-us) with an image of your desired custom banner logo. Your image should be:

* in PNG or SVG format
* at least 2x the size of the image that will be displayed on-screen
* cropped to leave minimal whitespace around the logo
* compressed (optimised for web)

## Banner background and border colour

You can make a request for custom colours [to GOV.UK Pay
directly](/support_contact_and_more_information/#contact-us).

Colours are customised using hexadecimal representations.

## Tell your users how to contact you

When you ask GOV.UK Pay to set up custom branding on your [payment confirmation emails](/payment_flow/#confirmation-email), you must tell your users how to contact you.

You can do this using a reply-to email address or another way such as a contact form.

If you use a reply-to email address, this email address can be a monitored email inbox for your service, or an unmonitored email address with an automated response.

If you use an unmonitored automated email response, you should tell your users:

- that the email address is unmonitored
- how your users can contact your service

You can customise your email responses in the GOV.UK Pay admin tool using the `customParagraph` field in the payment receipt email template.

You cannot customise your refund email.
