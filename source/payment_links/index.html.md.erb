# Payment links

Payment links allow you to receive online payments from your users without integrating with the GOV.UK Pay API. When a user accesses your payment link, theyâ€™ll be able to make an online card payment.

You may want to use payment links if your service:

* is non-digital and uses paper applications to process payments

* is non-digital and has low transaction volumes

* asks your users for payment by sending email or letters

* does not have a development team that can integrate your service with GOV.UK Pay

You can create payment links in English or Welsh.
