# Testing GOV.UK Pay

When your GOV.UK Pay account is made live, you will still have a ‘test’
account for general testing and experimenting with different settings and
features. You can read more in the [__Switching to
live__](/switching_to_live/#switching-to-live) section.

When you test, you should make sure that you use [mock card
numbers](#mock-card-numbers-for-testing) to simulate both successful
and unsuccessful transactions. You must use test cards with your test account.
Real card numbers will not work.

You should also:

 * only use your test account, not your live account

 * make sure that test calls to the GOV.UK Pay API succeed with [200 codes](/api_reference/#http-status-codes)

 * [test the whole user journey](/#test-your-service-with-your-users) from your service to the payment service provider

## HTTP with test accounts

Services using test accounts can optionally use HTTP (rather than HTTPS)
for return URLs. You can read more in [the __Security__
section](/security/#https).

## Make a demo payment

You can [try the payment experience as a
user](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/make-a-demo-payment), and
then view the completed payment in the GOV.UK Pay [transactions](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/transactions) list.

## Test your service with your users

You can [create a reusable
link](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/test-with-your-users) to
integrate your service prototype with GOV.UK Pay, and test with your users.
This feature only works in test accounts, and not in live accounts.

## Integration testing

To check your integration with GOV.UK Pay is working as expected, you should
run a series of tests. You can read more about [software
testing](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology#testing-your-service)
and [smoke
testing](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/making-software/deployment.html) in
the GOV.UK Service Manual.

Ideally you should build tests to include both the GOV.UK Pay API and its
frontend user journey. The GOV.UK Pay interface is continuously iterated, so
you should not rely on any specific page layout. You can still build tests
that address form elements such as buttons, using their IDs. Alternatively,
you can build stubs that will emulate GOV.UK Pay functionality.

You can read the section on [__How to integrate with the GOV.UK Pay
API__](/integrate_with_govuk_pay/#how-to-integrate-with-the-gov-uk-pay-api).
You can also read [the __Versioning__ section](/versioning/#versioning) to
find out about the evolution of the GOV.UK Pay API.

If you experience any problems when testing, please email us at
[govuk-pay-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk](mailto:govuk-pay-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk).

## Performance testing

The contract you have with GOV.UK Pay requires you to seek written approval from GOV.UK Pay before you conduct any performance testing.
If you’d like to carry out any kind of performance testing, including in a
rate-limiting environment, please contact us at
[govuk-pay-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk](mailto:govuk-pay-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk).

## Submit a test transaction using mock card numbers

When you test your integration with GOV.UK Pay by submitting a test transaction, you must use mock card numbers.

You can enter any valid value for the other required information for that test transaction. For example, card expiry dates can be any date in the future.

The following example mock card numbers only work with a test account. If you use mock card numbers after you have [switched to a live account](/switching_to_live/#switching-to-live), your payment service provider will not authorise the payment.
