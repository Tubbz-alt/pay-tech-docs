# Reporting

You can extract reporting information from GOV.UK Pay manually or via the
API, for each service you have set up in GOV.UK Pay.

You can also read about [refunding payments](/refunding_payments/), including
how to [search for refunds using the GOV.UK Pay API](/refunding_payments/#searching-refunds).

## Manual reporting

You can use your [GOV.UK Pay admin
account](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/login) to export
transaction information in a CSV file.

1. Select the account you want reporting information for in the [My Service](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/my-services) section.

2. Go to the [transactions](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/transactions) list.

3. Filter transactions using the available search criteria.

4. Select __Download all transaction details as a CSV file__.

The CSV file contains all transaction data, which is much more comprehensive than the information on the __Transactions__ page. You can process CSV files using
spreadsheet software and edit the contents you do not need.

You can export up to 100,000 transactions.

## Reporting via the GOV.UK Pay API

Before reading this section, you should be familiar with [making
payments](/making_payments).

You can get data from the GOV.UK Pay API in a format suitable for automatic
processing. For example, you could develop software to query the GOV.UK Pay
API for payment data periodically and import the data into your finance
system. This could remove routine manual operations from your workflow and
lead to significant cost savings for your organisation.

You can use the GOV.UK Pay API to:

* get information about a single payment

* generate a list of payments matching search criteria

## Get information about a single payment

`GET /v1/payments/paymentId`

See the <a href="https://govukpay-api-browser.cloudapps.digital/#getpayment" target="blank">GOV.UK Pay API browser</a> for more details

If the payment exists, the JSON response body to this
API call contains a `"state"` field. You can use this information when
designing a service.

For example, the response for a successful payment contains:

```
"state": {
  "status": "success",
  "finished": true
},
```

With a successful payment, you know that your user can continue their journey
through your service.

For a valid request, the JSON response body to this API call also contains
other useful information. For example, if your user has gone far enough in their
payment journey, the `"card_details"` section contains information that they
have entered when making a payment:

```
"card_details": {
  "card_type": "debit",
  "card_brand": "visa",
  "last_digits_card_number": "1111",
  "first_digits_card_number": "100002",
  "cardholder_name": "Sherlock Holmes",
  "expiry_date": "12/21",
  "billing_address": {
    "line1": "221 Baker Street",
    "line2": "Flat b",
    "postcode": "NW16XE",
    "city": "London",
    "country": "GB"
  }
}
```

The `card_type` is `null` if we did not recognise which type of card your user made the payment with.

### Checking when your Payment Service Provider (PSP) took a payment

If your PSP is Worldpay, you can see when Worldpay took a payment from your user's account.

The response contains:

- `capture_submit_time` if we've asked Worldpay to take the payment from your user's account
- `captured_date` if Worldpay has taken the payment

For example:

```
"settlement_summary": {
  "capture_submit_time": "2016-01-21T17:15:000Z",
  "captured_date": "2016-01-21"
}
```

You should receive the payment in your bank account within 2 business days of `captured_date`.

### PSP fees

If you use GOV.UK's Payment Service Provider (PSP), we'll automatically deduct the PSP's transaction fee from each payment. You can see how much the fee was when you make the API call to get information about a payment.

Example response:

```
"total_amount": 4000,
"fee": 200,
"net_amount": 3800
```

Where:

- `total_amount` is the amount your user paid in pence, including a [corporate card surcharge](/optional_features/corporate_card_surcharges/#corporate-card-surcharges) if you added one
- `fee` is the PSP transaction fee that we took from the amount your user paid, in pence
- `net_amount` is the amount that will be paid into your account, in pence

The response will not contain a `fee` or `net_amount` parameter if either:

- your PSP is SmartPay, Worldpay or ePDQ - we do not deduct these PSPs' transaction fees
- you're [using a test API key](/quick_start_guide/#test-the-api) - we do not deduct fees from test payments

You can also sign in to the [GOV.UK Pay admin tool](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/login) to see transaction fee information or export the information in a CSV file.

## Generate a list of payments (search payments)

`GET /v1/payments`

See the <a href="https://govukpay-api-browser.cloudapps.digital/#searchpayments" target="blank">GOV.UK Pay API browser</a> for more details

You must not search payments using the API to check a payment's status during [payment flow](/payment_flow). Search results are asynchronous so the payment status may not be up-to-date.

### Search criteria

An example search request:

`GET
/v1/payments?from_date=2018-10-01T13:30:00Z&to_date=2018-10-14T15:00:00Z&reference=12345&state=success`

Some of the query parameters you can use to search for payments are:

* `reference` - case insensitive, exact match only
* `email` - case insensitive
* `cardholder_name` - case insensitive
* `state` - case sensitive, exact match only
* `first_digits_card_number` - exact match only
* `last_digits_card_number` - exact match only

If you search for a specific payment, all criteria you use must match. Otherwise, that payment will not be returned in the results.

If your request has no query parameters, the API will return all payments.

#### Search by card brand


|`card_brand` to search for|`card_brand` in API response|
|---|---|
|`visa`|`Visa`|
|`master-card`|`Mastercard`|
|`maestro`|`Maestro`|
|`american-express`|`American Express`|
|`diners-club`|`Diners Club`|
|`discover`|`Discover`|
|`jcb`|`Jcb`|
|`unionpay`|`Union Pay`|

`card_brand` is case insensitive. You cannot search for partial values of `card_brand`.

#### Filter by date

You can use the following query parameters to filter payments by date:

* `from_date` - the start date for payments to be searched, inclusive

* `to_date` - the end date for payments to be searched, exclusive

These take inputs based on a subset of [the ISO
8601 standard](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-standards-for-government/date-times-and-time-stamps-standard).
For example, a valid input would be `2015-08-13T12:35:00Z`.

#### Pagination

You can use the following query parameters for pagination:

* `display-size` - default, and maximum, is `500`

* `page` - default is `1`

These must be a positive integer. For example, for the following search:

`GET
/v1/payments?from_date=2018-10-01T13:30:00Z&to_date=2018-10-14T15:00:00Z`

If there were 1543 payments in the response, you could paginate this as follows:

`GET
/v1/payments?from_date=2018-10-01T13:30:00Z&to_date=2018-10-14T15:00:00Z&display-size=500&page=2`

This would return payments 501-1000.
