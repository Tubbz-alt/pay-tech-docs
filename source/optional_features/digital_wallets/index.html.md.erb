# Digital wallets

You can enable [Google Pay](https://pay.google.com/intl/en_uk/about/) and [Apple Pay](https://www.apple.com/uk/apple-pay/) [external links] to take payments from your users.

This is an invitation-only feature currently in private beta. [Contact the GOV.UK Pay team](https://docs.payments.service.gov.uk/support_contact_and_more_information/#contact-us) to request this feature for your service. After GOV.UK Pay has approved your request to participate in this private beta, GOV.UK Pay will email you a link to enable this feature. 

You can only enable Google Pay and Apple Pay if you have a [live Worldpay account](/switching_to_live/set_up_a_live_worldpay_account/#set-up-a-live-worldpay-account).

## Enable Apple Pay

Sign in to the [GOV.UK Pay admin tool](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/).

1. Click on the link in the email from GOV.UK Pay.

1. Select __Enable__ next to Apple Pay.

1. On the __Enable Apple Pay__ screen, select __Yes, turn on Apple Pay__.

## Enable Google Pay

To enable Google Pay, you must enter a unique Google Pay merchant ID into your GOV.UK Pay account.

You get your Google Pay merchant ID from your Worldpay merchant admin interface.

1. If required, speak to your Worldpay account manager to upgrade your Worldpay merchant admin interface, so that the interface has Google Pay functionality.

1. Sign in to your [Worldpay merchant admin interface](https://secure.worldpay.com/sso/public/auth/login.html) [external link].

1. Go to __Integration__ and select the __Pay with Google__ tab.

1. Under __Generate unique merchant ID__, select __Generate__.

1. Copy the generated merchant ID.

Sign in to the [GOV.UK Pay admin tool](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/).

1. Click on the link in the email from GOV.UK Pay.

1. Select __Enable__ next to Google Pay.

1. On the __Enable Google Pay__ screen, select __Yes, turn on Google Pay__.

1. Enter the generated merchant ID and select __Submit__.

## 3D Secure authentication

Apple Pay requires that users authenticate digital wallet transactions using a secure method such as a fingerprint scan. Apple Pay users do not need to complete 3D Secure authentication separately.

Google Pay supports users authenticating digital wallet transactions using a secure method such as a fingerprint scan, but does not require it. Google Pay users who do not use Google Payâ€™s secure authentication may have to complete 3D Secure authentication separately.

## Restrictions

The GOV.UK Pay platform cannot apply [corporate card surcharges](/optional_features/corporate_card_surcharges/#corporate_card_surcharges) to digital wallet transactions made with a corporate card.

When you look at individual non-digital wallet transactions in your GOV.UK Pay account transactions list, you see the first 6 digits and last 4 digits of the card number. When you look at individual digital wallet transactions in your GOV.UK Pay account transactions list, you will only see the last 4 digits of the card number or digital wallet account number.

### Google Pay

You can restrict Google Pay digital wallet transactions by card scheme, but not by card type. For example, you can state that you only accept digital wallet transactions made with Visa cards, but you cannot only accept these transactions made with a debit card.
