# Digital wallets

You can enable [Google Pay](https://pay.google.com/intl/en_uk/about/) and [Apple Pay](https://www.apple.com/uk/apple-pay/) [external links] to take payments from your users.

You can only enable Google Pay and Apple Pay if you have a [live Worldpay account](/switching_to_live/set_up_a_live_worldpay_account/#set-up-a-live-worldpay-account) as your payment service provider (PSP).

If you use Stripe, [ePDQ](/switching_to_live/set_up_a_live_epdq_account/#set-up-a-live-epdq-account) or [Smartpay](/switching_to_live/set_up_a_live_smartpay_account/#set-up-a-live-smartpay-account) as your PSP, you cannot enable Apple Pay or Google Pay.

## Enable Apple Pay

Sign in to the [GOV.UK Pay admin tool](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/).

1. Go to __Settings__ and select __Card types__.

1. Select the __Digital wallet__ tab.

1. Select __Enable__ next to Apple Pay.

1. On the __Enable Apple Pay__ screen, select __Yes, turn on Apple Pay__.

## Enable Google Pay

To enable Google Pay, you must enter a unique Google Pay merchant ID into your GOV.UK Pay account.

You get your Google Pay merchant ID from your Worldpay merchant admin interface.

1. If required, speak to your Worldpay account manager to upgrade your Worldpay merchant admin interface, so that the interface has Google Pay functionality.

## 3D Secure

If a digital wallet transaction requires 3D Secure authentication, your users must complete 3D Secure authentication in the same way as non-digital wallet transactions.

## Restrictions

The GOV.UK Pay platform cannot apply [corporate card surcharges](/optional_features/corporate_card_surcharges/#corporate_card_surcharges) to digital wallet transactions made with a corporate card.

When you look at individual digital wallet transactions in your GOV.UK Pay account transactions list, you will only see the last 4 digits of the card number.

The expiry date for individual digital wallet transactions in your GOV.UK Pay account transactions list is the expiry date of the XYZ certificate rather than the payment expiry date.

### Google Pay

You cannot restrict Google Pay digital wallet transactions by card type. For example, you cannot only accept digital wallet transactions made with a debit card.

When you look at individual digital wallet transactions in your GOV.UK Pay account transactions list, you will only see the cardholder name if you have enabled [billing address collection](/integrate_with_govuk_pay/#collecting-your-users-39-billing-addresses).
