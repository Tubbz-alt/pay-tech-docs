# Prefill fields on the payment page

If you collect a user's details in your service before you redirect them to GOV.UK Pay, you can prefill some of the fields on the __Enter card details__ page. This means users should not need to enter their details twice.

Users can still edit the details before they complete their payment.

To prefill fields, include the following when you [create a new payment](/making_payments/#making-payments):

- an `email` parameter
- a `prefilled_cardholder_details` object with `cardholder_name` and `billing_address` parameters

For example:

```json
"email": "sherlock.holmes@example.com",
"prefilled_cardholder_details": {
    "cardholder_name": "Sherlock Holmes",
    "billing_address": {
        "line1": "221 Baker Street",
        "line2": "Flat b",
        "postcode": "NW1 6XE",
        "city": "London",
        "country": "GB"
 }
```

You can leave out any of the parameters.

The `country` parameter must be a valid <a href="https://www.iso.org/iso-3166-country-codes.html" target="blank">ISO 3166 code</a>. If the parameter is invalid or missing, the __Country or territory__ field will default to 'GB'.

## Which data is collected

After the user completes their payment, your [GOV.UK Pay admin
account](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/login) will collect the user's:

- email address - even if you've disabled collecting your users' email addresses
- cardholder name
- billing address - if you've enabled collecting your users' billing addresses
