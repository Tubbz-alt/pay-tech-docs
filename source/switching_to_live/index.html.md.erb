# Switching to live

Please read this information carefully.

Follow these steps to switch your account from ‘test’ to ‘live’. You should
only do this when you’ve finished [testing with your sandbox
account](/testing_govuk_pay/#testing-gov-uk-pay), and you’re confident that
[your integration is working](/integration_details/#integration-details).

This guidance is for services that have integrated
with the GOV.UK Pay API or which use the [payment
link](/payment_links/#payment-links) functionality.

Please read the guidance on what to do [before you switch to live](/switching_to_production/before_you_switch_to_live/#before-you-switch-to-live) first.

GOV.UK Pay currently supports [Worldpay](#set-up-a-live-worldpay-account),
[ePDQ](#set-up-a-live-epdq-account) and
[Smartpay](#set-up-a-live-smartpay-account) live gateways.
