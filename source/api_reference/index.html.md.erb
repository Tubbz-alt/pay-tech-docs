# API reference

The base URL for the GOV.UK Pay API is
`https://publicapi.payments.service.gov.uk/`.

The same base URL is used for test and live accounts. The API key you use
determines if actions are treated as test payments, or processed as real payments.

The API is based on REST principles. It returns data in JSON format, and uses
standard HTTP error response codes.

See the [__Quick start guide__](/quick_start_guide/#quick-start-guide) section
to read how to get started with the API quickly. Make sure you enter your test
API key to avoid generating real payments.

## API browser and Swagger file

For more detailed information on each API action, you can:

- open the <a href="https://govukpay-api-browser.cloudapps.digital/" target="blank">API browser</a>
- look at the <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/pay-publicapi/blob/master/swagger/swagger.json" target="blank">API Swagger file</a>

You can also generate a client library from the Swagger file using the <a href="http://editor.swagger.io/" target="blank">Swagger editor</a>. This may be an easier way for you to integrate your service with GOV.UK Pay than writing a client library from scratch.

## Authentication

GOV.UK Pay authenticates API calls with [OAuth2 HTTP bearer
tokens](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750). These are easy to
use and contain only your API key.

When you make an API call, you need to use an “Authorization” HTTP header to
provide your API key, with a “Bearer” prefix. For example:

```text
Authorization: Bearer <YOUR-API-KEY-HERE>
```

## Payment status lifecycle

The following diagram gives an overview of the payment status lifecycle and the
possible outcomes, excluding for delayed capture payments:

![](/images/payment-states.svg)

You can check the status of a payment using the <a
href="https://govukpay-api-browser.cloudapps.digital/#getpayment"
target="blank">Find payment by ID</a> API call.

A successful response includes ``status`` and ``finished`` values:

<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
  <th><code>status</code></th>
  <th>Meaning</th>
  <th nowrap><code>finished</code></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> created </td>
    <td> Payment created. User has not yet visited <code>next_url</code>. </td>
    <td> false </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> started </td>
    <td> User has visited <code>next_url</code> and is entering payment details. </td>
    <td> false </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> submitted </td>
    <td> User has submitted payment details but has not yet selected <b>Confirm</b>. </td>
    <td> false </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> capturable </td>
    <td> The payment is a <a href="/optional_features/delayed_capture/">delayed capture</a>, and your user has submitted payment details and selected <b>Confirm</b>. </td>
    <td> false </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> success </td>
    <td> User successfully completed the payment. </td>
    <td> true </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> failed </td>
    <td> User attempted to make a payment but the payment did not complete. </td>
    <td> true </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> cancelled </td>
    <td> Your service cancelled the payment using an API call or the GOV.UK Pay admin tool. </td>
    <td> true </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> error </td>
    <td> Something went wrong with GOV.UK Pay or the underlying payment service provider. Please <a href="/support_contact_and_more_information/#contact-us">contact us.</a> </td>
    <td> true </td>
  </tr>
</table>

## HTTP status codes

The GOV.UK Pay uses standard HTTP response code conventions:

* 100 codes are informational

* 200 codes indicate success

* 300 codes indicate a redirection

* 400 codes indicate a client-side error

* 500 codes indicate a server-side error

Common status codes are:

The general format of JSON error response bodies is:

```javascript
{
  "code": "PXXXX",
  "description": "Message explaining the error"
}
```

These error descriptions are intended for developers, not end users.

Some errors may contain additional fields , such as `field`.

### Errors caused by payment statuses

<div style="height:1px;font-size:1px;">&nbsp;</div>

| Error code | Meaning | Cause |
|------------|---------|-------|
| P0010 | Payment method rejected | Payment rejected due to payment method selected, or payment information entered. For example, failed fraud check, a 3D Secure authentication failure, or the user has insufficient funds in account. |
| P0020 | Payment expired | Payment was not confirmed and completed within 90 minutes of being created. If the payment was already authorised, GOV.UK Pay will send a cancellation to the payment provider. |

| P0040 | Payment was cancelled by your service | Your service cancelled the payment. |

<div style="height:1px;font-size:1px;">&nbsp;</div>

You can see which payments have status-related error codes using the GOV.UK
Pay admin tool or directly using the API.

#### Use the admin tool

1. Sign in to the [GOV.UK Pay admin tool](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/).

2. Select __Transactions__.

3. Use the __Payment status__ dropdown to find payments with error statuses. For example, “Declined”.

#### Use the API

You can use the API to examine the `state` object in a payment’s API response.

For example:

    ```
    {
        "amount": 2000,
        "state": {
            "status": "failed",
            "finished": true,
            "message": "Payment expired",
            "code": "P0020"
        },
    }
    ```

<div style="height:1px;font-size:1px;">&nbsp;</div>

## Rate limits

POST requests to the GOV.UK Pay API are rate-limited to 15 requests per
second, for each government service.

GET requests are also rate-limited, but at a very high level. In the future,
we will publish an official rate limit for GET requests.

If you exceed the rate limit, this will return HTTP status code “429” (Too
many requests) and error code P0900. After a second, you’ll be able to retry
your attempt in a reasonable way. For example, using exponential backoff.

Please [contact
us](https://docs.payments.service.gov.uk/support_contact_and_more_information/#contact-us)
if you would like to discuss rate limiting applied to your service account, or
give us feedback.
